# chr-fx

A Chrome extension that lets you highlight any major forex trading pair (EURUSD, EUR/USD, etc.) and get the current price plus daily & monthly charts.

Made with Vue, Chart.js, and [vue-cli-plugin-chrome-extension-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-cli-plugin-chrome-extension-cli)

## How it Works
I wasnâ€™t familiar with the file structure for Chrome extensions or vue-cli-plugin-chrome-extension-cli, and it took a while to figure everything out. Here's how I set it up:

1. src/entry/content.js interacts with the webpage. It listens for mouseup events and adds highlighted text to Chrome storage.
1. When the extension is clicked, src/view/popup.vue pulls the highlighted text from storage and checks whether it matches one of the forex pairs in the pairs array.
  1. If there is a match, popup.vue calls src/entry/components/FxData, a component that displays price data & charts.
  1. If not, popup.vue shows the instructions, located here: `<div v-else id="intro">`

## The Alpha Vantage API
Data provided by Alpha Vantage via their free API, which is limited to 5 calls/minute.
Exceed the limit and popup.vue calls src/entry/components/ErrCmp, which displays an error message.

ErrCmp is also triggered on failed requests.
